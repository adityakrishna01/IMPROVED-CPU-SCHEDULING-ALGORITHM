# IMPROVED-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHM
A new and improved CPU SCHEDULING ALGORITHM


In order to get rid of the drawbacks faced in previous round robin scheduling
algorithm and minimum context switches, maximum CPU utilization, maximum
throughput, minimum turnaround time, minimum waiting time, we have
proposed new method is proposed to find the best possible time quantum and
make the algorithm an efficient one.
